Sea surface temperature 

This program gets observed  and  model sea surface data. After running this program, a contour plot will be generated at
the end.
Remember to modify the hard code before you running a process.

Some functions are saved in 'sst_function.py'

There are flowcharts in this peckage to explan programs
